    <p>
      Primary production forms the foundation of the ocean's food chain, referring to the ability of photosynthetic organisms like phytoplankton to generate organic matter from inorganic compounds using sunlight as an energy source. This process not only sustains marine life but also plays a crucial role in regulating the global carbon cycle, affecting climate and ocean chemistry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the current climate context, understanding and predicting primary production in the ocean is essential due to global environmental changes. This project proposes the development of a digital twin using neural networks to estimate ocean primary production, improving accuracy and contributing to better marine resource management and climate change understanding.
